      <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: July 28, 2024</p>

      <p>
        This policy outlines the terms for cancelling services, subscriptions, or bookings made through Naarimani.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Subscriptions (Premium Membership)</h2>
      <p>
        This is placeholder text. If you offer subscriptions, you need a clear cancellation policy. It should include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How a user can cancel their subscription (e.g., through their account settings).</li>
        <li>The notice period required for cancellation.</li>
        <li>What happens after cancellation (e.g., access continues until the end of the billing period).</li>
        <li>Whether refunds are provided for partial subscription periods (usually they are not).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Booked Professional Sessions</h2>
      <p>
        For consultations or sessions booked with professionals in our directory:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Cancellations by You:</strong> You may cancel a session up to 24 hours before the scheduled time for a full refund. Cancellations made within 24 hours are non-refundable.</li>
          <li><strong>Cancellations by the Professional:</strong> If a professional cancels a session, you will receive a full refund or the option to reschedule.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Course Enrollments</h2>
      <p>
        Once you enroll in a course, you have 48 hours to request a cancellation and full refund, provided you have not accessed more than 10% of the course material. After this period, course fees are non-refundable.
      </p>
