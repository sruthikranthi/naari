      <p>
        Thank you for shopping at Sakhi Circle. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the stuff we build. We also want
        to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products.
      </p>
      
      <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This is placeholder text. A Refund Policy is crucial for e-commerce and paid services. You should clearly state:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The conditions under which a refund is eligible (e.g., defective product, service not rendered).</li>
        <li>The time frame within which a refund request must be made (e.g., 7 days from purchase).</li>
        <li>The process for requesting a refund (e.g., contact support, fill a form).</li>
        <li>The form of refund (e.g., original payment method, store credit).</li>
        <li>Any non-refundable items or services (e.g., digital downloads, completed consultations).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Digital Products & Courses</h2>
      <p>
        For digital products and online courses, we generally do not offer refunds once the content has been accessed or downloaded.
        However, we may consider a refund on a case-by-case basis if you can demonstrate that the product was not as described or is technically faulty.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Marketplace Physical Goods</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds for physical goods purchased through the marketplace are subject to the individual seller's return and refund policy.
        Sakhi Circle facilitates the connection but is not directly responsible for the seller's products. Please check the seller's policy on the product page before purchasing.
      </p>
