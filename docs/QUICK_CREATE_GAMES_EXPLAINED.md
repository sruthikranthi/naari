# Quick Create - Sample Games Explained

## What Are These?

These are **NOT placeholders** - they are **fully functional sample game creators** that will create complete, working games with pre-configured questions when you click "Create Game".

## How They Work

When you click "Create Game" on any of these sample games:

1. ✅ **Creates a complete game** with:
   - Title and description
   - Start time, end time, and result reveal time
   - Entry coins (usually 10 coins)
   - Tags and categories
   - Status set to "active"

2. ✅ **Automatically adds 2-3 sample questions** to the game:
   - Pre-configured question text
   - Appropriate prediction types (up-down, range, multiple-choice, etc.)
   - Points and scoring rules
   - Proper ordering

3. ✅ **Game is immediately ready** - Users can start playing right away!

## Example: Gold Price Game

When you click "Create Game" on "Gold Price", it creates:

**Game Details:**
- Title: "Gold Ornament Price Prediction - Tomorrow"
- Description: "Predict tomorrow's gold ornament price per gram. Test your market intuition!"
- Duration: 24 hours (starts now, ends in 24 hours)
- Entry: 10 coins

**Questions Added Automatically:**

## How to Add More Questions/Events to These Games

⚠️ **Important Limitation**: The current "Edit Game" dialog only allows editing basic game details (title, description, entry coins, status). It does NOT allow adding new questions.

### Option 1: Use "Create Custom Game" from the Start (Recommended)

If you need more than 2-3 questions, use **"Create Custom Game"** instead:

1. Click **"Create Custom Game"** button
2. Fill in all game details
3. Use the **"Add Event"** button to add 10-18 questions
4. Configure each question with:
   - Question text
   - Prediction type (up-down, range, multiple-choice, image-based, etc.)
   - Options (if multiple-choice)
   - Points and scoring rules
   - Image upload (optional)
   - Sponsor selection (optional)
5. Add main sponsor for the game
6. Upload game banner image

### Option 2: Create Quick Create Game, Then Create Custom Game

If you want to use Quick Create as a template:

1. Click "Create Game" on a Quick Create sample
2. See what questions it creates
3. Create a new **"Create Custom Game"** with similar settings
4. Add all your questions (10-18) from the start
5. Delete the Quick Create game if you don't need it

### Option 3: Manual Question Addition (Advanced)

Currently, there's no UI to add questions to existing games. You would need to:
- Use Firebase Console directly
- Or wait for future feature updates

**Recommendation**: Use **"Create Custom Game"** if you need more than 2-3 questions!
